# Biopython as a drop-in replacement to EMBOSS

### Abstract

DNA sequencing remains one of the greatest innovations of the millenium, evolving from billion dollar behemoths such as the Human Genome Project to the modern-day Flongle, a 
device which fits in the palm of your hand and costs a mere $1,500.  Accompanying this rapid miniaturization of DNA sequencing hardware is the democratization of DNA 
sequencing software - where biologists used to need to purchase expensive software to analyze their sequences, they can now use myriad websites, apps, or programs to 
organize and understand their sequences.  However, software is never finished, dogged by the threat of a better solution just over the horizon.  

Since the early 2000s, the software package EMBOSS (European Molecular Biology Open Source Software) was the application *du jour*, used by labs all around the world. 
However, development of EMBOSS ceased in 2013, leaving a power vacuum soon filled by the package BioPython.  Migrating from EMBOSS to Biopython remains difficult and 
at times confusing.
